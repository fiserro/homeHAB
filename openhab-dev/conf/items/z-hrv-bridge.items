// HRV Bridge MQTT Items
// Links HRV output items to MQTT channels for the Python DAC Bridge
//
// These items receive commands from HrvControl.java and publish to MQTT.
// The Python bridge subscribes to these topics and controls the motors.
//
// Note: These items override the auto-generated items from habstate-items.items
// The channel links ensure values are published to MQTT for the bridge.

// Base power output - for single-motor or balanced (50:50) setups
